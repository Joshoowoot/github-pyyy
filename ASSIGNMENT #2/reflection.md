When doing the Django setup I learned about many things such as Python version, venv active, Django version, runserver working, and Git remote set. So at first, I was amazed about the virtual environment(venv) thing, since it is my first time tackling that kind of things. Imagine downloading Django in the folder only and it is not globalized, just how fascinating it is. So, as the set up tutorial goes on, it went smooth. I was gliding at the steps without hassle, thanks to my fast learning brain :). Then suddenly when it comes to GIT remote, At first, I was backed up a bit because its my first time doing it in terminal. So I watch youtube and understand the tutorial carefully so that I can learn it quickly. As time goes by, I learned many commands such as, git --version, git add ., git push -u origin main, git status and many more. So, I return to my task to continue finishing it. And in the end, here I am now writing reflection about my journey. There's not much challenge to it as of now since it is just an introductory part. Just save the hard part on the last hehehe.
